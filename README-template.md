## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This is the first time using CSS Grid. I have only used flex box up tp this point
I found it easier to center a card on the screen with the code below

body {
    display: grid;
    place-content: center;
}

### Continued development

I need to work more on CSS Grid. It is very complex and a lot to learn, but its easier for certain layouts like this one
